the data is from : https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/ 
here are precutions worth to note 

1- every file downloaded, changed its name it data. actully it minimized to show the imported informations , for exapmle from this October-2023-AE-by-provider-4uCT2.xls 
to this October-2023.xls 


2- the files are xls .this means they may have diffrent tables.but the only table which is commen with them is provider data.moreover the python only reads first table of a xls files. so that in those files which have several tables and provider table is not its first table , they need to be replaced to its first table.


the rest just done by code but its needs to directory fixed to the locall pc and follow the same structure since i used os library to read files.
